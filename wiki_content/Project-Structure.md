# Discord Purge Project Structure and Scaffolding: Understanding the Codebase

This document details the **project structure and scaffolding** for the **Discord Purge utility**. Understanding the organization of the codebase is crucial for development, maintenance, and contributing to this **Discord message deletion and privacy management tool**. The project adheres to a clean, modular structure, leveraging the strengths of **Rust** and **Tauri**.

The directory structure and setup commands from the previous version are sound and will be adhered to, providing a clear roadmap for **Discord Purge development**.

(Further detailed insights into the exact directory structure, including specific folders for the Rust backend, TypeScript frontend, and Tauri configurations, can be found within the project's repository. This organized approach facilitates efficient **Discord cleanup tool** development and scalability.)
