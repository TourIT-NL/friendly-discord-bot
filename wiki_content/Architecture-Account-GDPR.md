# Discord Purge Account & GDPR Management Flow: Ensuring Privacy Compliance

This document details the **Account and GDPR Management flow** within the **Discord Purge utility**. Recognizing Discord's API limitations regarding direct programmatic account deletion or bulk GDPR data removal, this **privacy management tool** is designed to securely and efficiently guide users through Discord's official processes, ensuring **privacy compliance** and user control over their digital footprint.

- **Multi-Server Message Deletion**: The Rust backend's `bulk_delete_messages` command is already capable of processing a `Vec<String>` of channel IDs. This means it can efficiently handle **Discord message deletion** across multiple guilds (servers) and Direct Messages (DMs) in a single operation. The primary user interface challenge is to provide an intuitive frontend mechanism for multi-selection across these locations within the **Discord cleanup tool**.
- **Profile Deletion Guidance**:
  - **Backend (`src-tauri/src/api/discord.rs`)**: A new Tauri command, `open_discord_url_for_action(action_type: String)`, will be implemented. This command will take an `action_type` (e.g., "account_deletion") and securely use `tauri::api::shell::open` to launch the user's default web browser to the relevant official Discord URL (e.g., Discord's account settings page specifically for deletion). This guides users directly to the necessary **Discord account management** interface.
  - **Frontend (`src/App.tsx`)**: A dedicated "Delete Profile" button will trigger a confirmation modal with strong warnings to ensure the user understands the irreversible nature of the action. Upon user confirmation, it will call the `open_discord_url_for_action` backend command, guiding the user to Discord's official account deletion process. Following this, the **Discord Purge application** UI will then log out the user, ensuring security.
- **GDPR Data Request Assistance**:
  - **Backend**: The `open_discord_url_for_action` command can also be utilized to securely open official Discord web pages related to Data & Privacy settings or support portals, facilitating **GDPR data requests**.
  - **Frontend**: A "GDPR Data Request" button (or similar UI element within the **Discord privacy utility**) will provide clear, step-by-step instructions to the user:
    1.  Guidance on how to download their personal data package directly from Discord's User Settings > Data & Privacy.
    2.  Information on how to formally contact Discord Support to request more extensive **bulk message deletion**, potentially including advice on providing a CSV of channel IDs (which can be derived from their downloaded data package). This will likely involve opening Discord's support portal via `open_discord_url_for_action`, streamlining the **Discord data management** process.
