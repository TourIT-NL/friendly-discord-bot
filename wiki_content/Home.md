## 🎯 Vision & Core Tenets

Our mission is to restore **Digital Sovereignty** to every Discord user. We operate under three unbreakable laws:

1.  **🛡️ Unyielding Security**: Your data stays local. Your tokens are encrypted in the OS keychain. Every line of code is auditable.
2.  **⚡ Peak Performance**: Deleting 10,000 messages should feel as fast as deleting one. Our asynchronous Rust backend makes this a reality.
3.  **💖 Total User Empowerment**: We don't hide behind complex menus. We provide a powerful, intuitive GUI that makes privacy accessible to everyone.

## 🏆 Current MVP Definition

The **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for Discord Purge is:
> A fully distributable and installable **desktop application** that enables a user to securely log in via Discord OAuth2 and seamlessly utilize the **Bulk Message Deletion** feature from end-to-end, all presented through a professional, M3-compliant user interface.
