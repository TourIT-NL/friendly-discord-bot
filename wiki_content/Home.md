Welcome to the official Wiki for **Discord Purge**, the definitive **desktop application** designed for advanced **Discord message deletion** and comprehensive **privacy management**. This document serves as the central blueprint, detailing the vision, core tenets, and foundational aspects of this powerful **Discord cleanup utility** built with **Rust** and **Tauri**.

## 1. Vision & Core Tenets: Shaping the Discord Purge Experience

The overarching vision for **Discord Purge** is to deliver a powerful, aesthetically pleasing, and high-performance **desktop application** that grants Discord users unparalleled control over their digital footprint.


1.  **Unyielding Security**: The security of the user's data and Discord account integrity are our highest priorities. This encompasses both technical implementation (e.g., secure **OAuth2 authentication**, OS-level secure storage for tokens) and user experience design (e.g., clear warnings for destructive actions like **bulk message deletion**).
2.  **Peak Performance**: The **Discord Purge application** must feel exceptionally fast and responsive, regardless of the scale of the task (e.g., deleting thousands of messages).
