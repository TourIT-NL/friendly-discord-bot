### Developer Build and Contribution

We warmly welcome and highly encourage contributions from our vibrant community! Your efforts are essential to the growth and continuous improvement of **Friendly Discord Bot**. Please refer to our `CONTRIBUTING.md` for comprehensive guidelines on how to get started, our preferred code style, and the pull request process.

**Prerequisites for Developers:**

Before you dive into the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- [**Rust toolchain**](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (stable version recommended) 🦀: The backbone of our secure and performant backend.
- [**Node.js LTS**](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Long Term Support version) 🟢: Essential for managing frontend dependencies and build processes.
- [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/) or npm 📦: Our preferred package managers for frontend development.
- [**Tauri prerequisites**](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) for your specific development platform 🖥️: Depending on your OS, additional system dependencies might be required for Tauri development.

**Step-by-Step Build Instructions:**

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the Friendly Discord Bot repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/TourIT-NL/friendly-discord-bot.git

# Step 2: Navigate into the project's root directory
cd friendly-discord-bot/discord-privacy-util # Ensure you are in the correct workspace root

# Step 3: Install all necessary frontend dependencies (React, TypeScript, etc.)
yarn install # Alternatively, use 'npm install' if you prefer npm

# Step 4: Build the optimized frontend assets (Vite)
yarn build # Alternatively, use 'npm run build'

# Step 5: Build the high-performance Rust backend in release mode
# This command builds the entire Rust workspace, including the Tauri core.
cargo build --release --workspace

# Step 6: Package the cross-platform desktop application binaries
# This step utilizes Tauri's CLI to create distributable installers for your OS.
yarn tauri build # Alternatively, use 'npm run tauri build'
```

_(**Important Note**: For a complete release build across the entire Rust workspace, always use `cargo build --release --workspace` to ensure all components are optimized.)_

### Testing and Quality Assurance: Our Commitment to Excellence

Ensuring the stability, functionality, and ironclad security of **Friendly Discord Bot** is not just a goal; it is a paramount commitment woven into every stage of our development process.

- **🔬 Unit Tests**: We implement robust and granular unit tests for all core logic, our sophisticated API dispatcher, and critical utility functions. These tests isolate individual components, verifying their correctness and reliability.
- **🧪 Integration Tests**: Comprehensive integration tests are designed to rigorously evaluate interactions with the Discord API. We often employ mocked endpoints to simulate real-world API responses and scenarios, ensuring seamless communication and error handling.
- **🤖 End-to-End Tests**: Our UI flows undergo rigorous end-to-end testing utilizing headless automation frameworks. These tests simulate authentic user interactions, from launching the application to executing complex cleanup sequences, verifying the entire user journey.
- **🔒 Security Tests**: Proactive security is a cornerstone. We integrate regular static analysis, perform thorough dependency scanning (via `cargo audit` for Rust and `npm audit` for Node.js/frontend dependencies), and strictly adhere to industry-leading secure coding practices throughout development.
- **Manual QA Across Platforms**: Extensive manual Quality Assurance (QA) is diligently performed across all supported operating systems – Windows, macOS, and Linux – utilizing dedicated test accounts to catch edge cases and ensure a polished user experience.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

Encountering an unexpected behavior? Don't worry, we're here to help you get back on track.

- For a detailed compendium of common issues, their known fixes, and in-depth logging information, please consult our comprehensive [**Troubleshooting Guide**](SUPPORT.md) or explore the relevant sections of our [**Project Wiki**](https://github.com/TourIT-NL/friendly-discord-bot/wiki).
- **Typical User Issues & Resolutions**:
  - **Login Fails**:
    - **Resolution**: Double-check that your OAuth2 redirect configuration is correctly set up in your Discord Developer portal. Also, ensure your system's date and time are accurate and synchronized.
  - **Rate Limit Errors**:
    - **Resolution**: Our application automatically handles most rate limits. If you encounter persistent issues, try utilizing the application's "conservative" rate profile (if available in settings) and ensure the exponential backoff feature is enabled.
  - **Missing Messages in Preview**:
    - **Resolution**: Confirm that the Discord account connected to the application has the necessary permissions to access and read the specific conversations or channels you are trying to scan. Also, verify that the application has been granted the required permissions during the OAuth2 process.
  - **Application Crashes Unexpectedly**:
    - **Resolution**: Retrieve the crash logs from your local system. On Windows, these are typically found at `%APPDATA%/FriendlyDiscordBot/logs`. On macOS, look in `~/Library/Logs/FriendlyDiscordBot`. On Linux, check `~/.config/FriendlyDiscordBot/logs`. Once you have the logs, please open a detailed issue on our GitHub repository and attach the log files for our development team to analyze.
