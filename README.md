### Troubleshooting Common Issues

Encountering an unexpected behavior or a technical hiccup during your **Discord cleanup**? Don't worry, it happens! We've compiled a list of common issues and their effective solutions to help you get back on track with your operations as quickly as possible.

- For a highly detailed compendium of common issues, their known fixes, and in-depth logging information, please consult our comprehensive [**Troubleshooting Guide**](SUPPORT.md) or explore the relevant sections of our [**Project Wiki**](https://github.com/TourIT-NL/friendly-discord-bot/wiki). These resources are continuously updated based on user feedback.
- **Typical User Issues & Resolutions**:
  - **Login Fails**:
    - **Problem**: You are unable to successfully log in to your Discord account via the application, or the OAuth2 flow encounters an error.
    - **Resolution**: First, double-check that your OAuth2 redirect configuration is correctly set up in your Discord Developer portal if you are building from source or managing your own application ID. The redirect URI must precisely match. Also, ensure your system's date and time are accurate and synchronized, as time discrepancies can cause authentication failures with secure protocols.
  - **Persistent Rate Limit Errors**:
    - **Problem**: The application reports repeated or unrecoverable Discord API rate limit errors, causing operations to stall or fail.
    - **Resolution**: Our application automatically handles most rate limits intelligently. However, if you encounter persistent issues, try utilizing the application's "conservative" rate profile (if available in the settings menu) to further reduce API call frequency. Also, ensure the exponential backoff feature is actively enabled, which helps in graceful recovery from temporary API blocks.
  - **Messages or Servers Missing in Preview**:
    - **Problem**: Items you expect to see (e.g., old messages, certain servers you are a member of) do not appear in the preview list for **Discord data removal**.
    - **Resolution**: Confirm that the Discord account currently connected to the application has the necessary permissions to access and read the specific conversations, channels, or servers you are trying to scan. Also, thoroughly verify that the application has been granted all the required permissions during the initial OAuth2 authentication process. Old servers you've been removed from or private channels you no longer have access to might not appear.
  - **Application Crashes Unexpectedly**:
    - **Problem**: The application closes abruptly, becomes unresponsive, or displays a generic error message.
    - **Resolution**: Retrieve the crash logs from your local system. On Windows, these are typically found at `%APPDATA%/FriendlyDiscordBot/logs`. On macOS, look in `~/Library/Logs/FriendlyDiscordBot`. On Linux, check `~/.config/FriendlyDiscordBot/logs`. Once you have the logs, please open a detailed issue on our GitHub repository and attach the log files for our development team to analyze. This greatly assists in diagnostics and helps us improve stability.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Find quick, concise, and helpful answers to the most common inquiries about **Friendly Discord Bot** and responsible **Discord data management**.

- **Is using this application safe for my Discord account?**
  - **Answer**: Yes, your account's safety is our absolute top priority. The application is meticulously designed with paramount security in mind, incorporating robust features like secure OAuth2 authentication, intelligent rate-limiting, and strictly local-only processing of your data. While no third-party tool can definitively guarantee zero risk due to platform-specific Terms of Service which are subject to change, we strive to minimize it significantly. We strongly recommend always using the OAuth2 login method and diligently following our in-app safety checklist for the best possible protection.
- **Does the app store or upload any of my Discord messages or personal data to external servers?**
  - **Answer**: Absolutely not. This is a cornerstone of our unwavering privacy commitment. All your messages and personal data are processed **exclusively and entirely on your local machine**. They are never uploaded, stored, or transmitted remotely to our servers or any external service whatsoever. Your data remains solely on your device, under your complete control.
- **Will using this tool lead to my Discord account being banned or suspended by Discord?**
  - **Answer**: We cannot provide an absolute, ironclad guarantee against any potential account actions by Discord, as platform policies can change, and interpretations vary.
